# Portfolio Website

This is a fun and interactive project where we covered the basics of HTML and CSS. Below is a brief overview of the project we worked on - a Portfolio Website for Daniel - a member of CedarTech.

## Project Overview

### HTML Structure

We started by creating the basic structure of our HTML document. Here's a quick look at the key sections:

- **Navbar**: Contains links to Home, About, and Contact pages.
- **Hero Section**: Features a profile picture and a brief introduction.
- **Skills Section**: Lists various skills such as UI/UX Design, Web Design, and more.
- **Footer**: Contains copyright information.

### CSS Styling

We then moved on to styling our website using CSS. Some of the key areas we covered include:

- **Typography**: Using Google Fonts to enhance the text appearance.
- **Layout**: Utilizing Flexbox and Grid to create a fun layout.
- **Colors and Backgrounds**: Adding colors and background images to make the website visually appealing.
